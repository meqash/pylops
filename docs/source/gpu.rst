GPU support
===========
From ``v1.12.0``, PyLops supports computations on GPUs powered by
``cupy`` and ``cusignal``.

Apart from a few exceptions, all operators and solvers in PyLops can
seamlessly work with ``numpy`` arrays on CPU as well as with ``cupy`` arrays
on GPU. Users do simply need to consistently create operators and
provide data vectors to the solvers - e.g., when using
:class:`pylops.MatrixMult` the input matrix must be a
cupy array if the data provided to a solver is a cupy array.

:class:`pylops.LinearOperator` methods that are currently not available for
GPU computations are:

- ``eigs``, ``cond``, and ``tosparse``

Operators that are currently not available for GPU computations are:

- :class:`pylops.Spread`
- :class:`pylops.signalprocessing.Radon2D`
- :class:`pylops.signalprocessing.Radon3D`
- :class:`pylops.signalprocessing.DWT`
- :class:`pylops.signalprocessing.DWT2D`
- :class:`pylops.signalprocessing.Seislet`
- :class:`pylops.waveeqprocessing.Demigration`
- :class:`pylops.signalprocessing.LSM`

Solvers that are currently not available for GPU computations are:

- :class:`pylops.optimization.sparsity.SPGL1`
